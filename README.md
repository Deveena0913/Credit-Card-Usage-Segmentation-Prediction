## Overview:
This project focuses on developing unsupervised learning models for customer segmentation based on credit card usage data. The models aim to provide insights into distinct customer segments, improve credit risk assessment, and optimize marketing strategies. Deliverables include segmentation models, comprehensive data visualizations, and a comparative analysis of various algorithms.

## Problem Statement:
Develop comprehensive unsupervised learning models to accurately segment credit card customers based on their spending and payment behaviors. By utilizing these models, the institution aims to improve targeted marketing, risk assessment, and overall customer relationship management.

## Dataset Description:
- 8950 rows and 18 columns
- Attributes include Balance, Purchases, Cash Advances etc

## Machine Learning Task:
This project employs unsupervised learning, working with PCA , t-SNE, K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering 

## Methodology:
### Data Analysis:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and patterns
- Correlation between features

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Transforming categorical variables (using encoding)
- Standard scaling numerical features
- Applying PCA and t- SNE

### Model Building and Evaluation:
- Applying K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Clustering
- Comparing both the Clustering methods using scores 

## Outcome:
K- Means is the best supporting method
